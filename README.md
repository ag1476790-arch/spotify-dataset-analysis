##  Key Analyses

### **1. Data Exploration**
Initial inspection confirmed a diverse dataset with rich metadata and well-populated audio features suitable for time-series and clustering analysis.

### **2. Popularity Segmentation**
Top 25% of tracks (by Spotifyâ€™s popularity score) were analyzed separately to focus on mainstream listening trends.

### **3. Feature Distribution**
Explored the statistical distributions of popularity, duration, key, tempo, loudness, and other attributes to understand foundational trends.

### **4. Clustering Popular Songs**
Applied **K-Means clustering** on `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, and `speechiness` to uncover latent sound profiles:
- **Cluster 0:** Pop/Vocal-Centric  
- **Cluster 1:** Acoustic/Warm  
- **Cluster 2:** Instrumental/Cinematic  

### **5. Cross-Lingual Insights**
Analyzed danceability, energy, and valence across languages, revealing cultural preferences in musical style and mood.

### **6. Time-Series Trends**
Tracked year-over-year evolution in:
- Danceability & Energy  
- Acousticness & Instrumentalness  
- Loudness & Valence  
- Liveness & Song Duration

##  Insights & Findings

- **Danceability and Energy** have steadily increased, reflecting a modern preference for upbeat, rhythm-driven music.  
- **Acousticness** has generally declined, signaling a shift toward more electronic and studio-produced sounds.  
- **Major modes (1.0)** and **4/4 time signatures** dominate popular music, providing rhythmic familiarity.  
- **Cross-language analysis** shows unique emotional and energetic characteristics for each linguistic group.

##  Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that popular music is an ever-evolving art form influenced by cultural, technological, and emotional forces.  
Data-driven methods reveal not only what songs are popular but **how the sound and emotional design of music itself have changed over time**.

By leveraging audio features and machine learning, researchers and creators can better understand global music patterns and anticipate future directions in the industry.
